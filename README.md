# Lab-7
Computer Architecture Lab Assignment

For this lab, I created a program counter and instruction decoder for a processor which uses RISC-V ISA. It is also be connected together with instruction memory.

Two essential parts of a computer processor are the program counter and instruction decoder. The program counter in a processor is what keeps track of the address of the instruction being executed in a program at any time. The instruction decoder reads the instruction at the address in the program counter and decodes it into components to be sent to their different places.
